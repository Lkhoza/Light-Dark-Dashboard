# Functional requirements and notes

Light/Dark switch
- set css root properties using js
- account for system default
- correct radio markup -- https://codepen.io/renddrew/pen/bRomab
- make sure fieldset and legend tags surround radio label -- https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/forms/good-example/

CSS custom properties/ variables
- corrrect markup for js interaction

Prefers color scheme media query?

HTML accessibility
- correct semantic structure (headings and tags)
- correct ARIA for navigation

# Day 1 reflections

- always note and research project requirements before stating. Streamlines process and saves time.

# Day 2 

- gitignore file tells github what not to upload to the repository. node modules shouldnt be uploaded as the clutter the repository

  ## SCSS
    - scss is the new way to write css. It allows for much more modulated structure to css code and new features
    - Codercoder uses a utils folder with nested a scss functions file for rem calculations and a breakpoints file for writing media queries like reusable functions.

- Knowing how to research is more important than knowing how to code. Strong research habits before starting and during a coding project are key. Spend the hours on necessary prep work.
